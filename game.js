Before the war began, you were attending university, and working multiple jobs to pay for tuition while also having the responsibility of providing for your family. With your sick parents unable to work and your young twin siblings, Centola and Carim, too young to work, you had taken on the role of caretaker and provider. As the conflict intensified, your parents passed away because of illness, leaving you devastated and now with even more responsibility. Determined to protect your family, you put your dreams of education and a better life on hold, leaving university and taking over more jobs. Even with everything going on you found purpose in joining the White Helmets, an organization dedicated to saving lives with the chaos of the war. For several months, you risked everything, pulling hundreds of people from the brink of death. Some of your friends expressed concern, cautioning you about the dangers you faced, but you were determined to keep on going. With everything going on and with all your work, you inadvertently neglected your primary responsibility your siblings. Disaster struck when Carim, your beloved brother, became a casualty of an airstrike while playing outside with his friends. The weight of grief tore down on your heart. News of the takeover of Aleppo by Assad's government and the consequences for those who opposed them propelled you into action. It became clear that for the safety of yourself and your remaining sibling, Centola, you had to leave Syria behind. Austria which you heard many people talking about became your place of hope where you could seek asylum and rebuild your lives.",
